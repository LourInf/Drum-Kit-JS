### Main learnings:
1. **DOM Manipulation:** Select and manipulate DOM elements using document.querySelectorAll and document.querySelector.
2. **Event Handling:** Using event listeners (addEventListener) to respond to user interactions. In this case it was: button clicks ("click") and keyboard key presses ("keydown").
3. **Looping Through Elements:** Using a for loop to iterate over a collection of elements and attach event listeners to each of them.
4. **Anonymous Functions:** Defining and using anonymous functions as event handlers.
5. **"this" Keyword:** Understanding the use of the this keyword inside an event listener function to refer to the element that triggered the event.
6. **Switch Statement:** Implementing a switch statement to handle different cases based on the value of a variable (key in this case).
7. **Audio Playback:** Using the Audio constructor to create audio objects and the play method to play associated audio files.
8. **Dynamic Styling:** Changing the style of elements dynamically by adding and removing CSS classes (classList.add and classList.remove).
9. **Timeout Function:** Using setTimeout to create a delayed action. In this project, removing a class after a few seconds to create a visual effect.
10. **Error Handling:** Including a default case in the switch statement and logging to the console when an unexpected key or button is encountered.
